      "p2":"Algorithms, Multitasking, the sharing economy, life hacks: our culture can't get enough of efficiency. One of the great promises of the Internet and big Data revolutions is the idea that we can improve the processes and routines of our Work and Personal lives to get more done in less Time than we ever have before. There is no doubt that we're performing at higher Levels and moving at unprecedented speed, but what if we're headed in the wrong direction? Melding the long-term History of Technology with the latest headlines and findings of computer Science and Social Science, The efficiency paradox questions our ingrained assumptions about efficiency, persuasively showing how relying on the Algorithms of Digital platforms can in fact lead to wasted efforts, missed opportunities, and, above all, an inability to break out of established patterns. Edward tenner offers a smarter way of thinking about efficiency, revealing what we and our institutions, when equipped with an astute combination of Artificial Intelligence and trained intuition, can learn from the random and unexpected."

      "p1":"",
      "p2":"The whole of Marx's project confronts the narrow concerns of political Philosophy by embedding it in social Philosophy and a certain understanding of the aesthetic. From those of aesthetic production to the , (as Marx writes in the Eighteenth Brumaire), from the radical modernism of bourgeois development to the very idea of association (which defined one of the main lines of tradition in the History of aesthetics), steady references to Dante, Shakespeare and Goethe, and the idea that bourgeois Politics is nothing but a theatrical stage: the aesthetic has a prominent place in the constellation of Marx's thought. This book offers an original and challenging study of both Marx in the aesthetic, and the aesthetic in Marx. It differs from previous discussions of Marxist aesthetic Theory as it understands the works of Marx themselves as contributions to thinking the aesthetic. This is an engagement with Marx's aesthetic that takes into account Marx's broader sense of the aesthetic, as identified by Eagleton and Buck-Morss - as a question of sense perception and the body. It explores this through questions of style and substance in Marx and extends it into Contemporary questions of how this legacy can be perceived or directed analytically in the present. By situating Marx in Contemporary art debates this volume speaks directly to lively Interest today in the function of the aesthetic in accounts of emancipatory Politics and is essential reading for researchers and academics across the fields of political Philosophy, art Theory, and Marxist scholarship."
